# Visual-Programming Mini-Project 3 Team 2

Here is a discription of the functionality and implementation of the project.

The project is implemented in a way that we take as an input the Intermediate Code "Output file from Mini-Project 1" and then compile it into `python executable code`, which is a utilization of the `turtle library` in python.
